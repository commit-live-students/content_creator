Before we begin content development, we'd like to take the time to introduce you to our process to ensure that your GreyAtom experience and your content are as successful and enjoyable as possible.


# GreyAtom Introduction

At GreyAtom, we believe in a learn by doing approach.We have gained great insights into how people learn best and we are now using these insights to move towards an online learning model that delivers the holy trinity of Quality, Scale and Personalization in education.

## Building Sample Content for GreyAtom

During course design process, you will be required to build one or more chapters of a concept. For Eg - If the concept is Linear Regression, we would like you to build - 

	- Onboarding a problem statement that can be solved using Linear Regression
	- OLS
	- A coding task to internalize OLS

We have 2 main deliverables to be submitted as a Sample. Based on your interest and discussion with GreyAtom team , you will be submitting either of these.


1. Learning Content - Here we explain the main concept and its subtopics very intuitively, always building intuition of learner first, before onboarding any code/Math. This is done by bringing to life real examples and asking a lot of questions to learner. As you move along, keep throwing small coding tasks to the learner that can help them internalize what they have read and understood so far. Coding tasks should have detailed instructions.

Reference Learning Content - Look at this notebook and get inspired on how your final submission could look like. Of course, we are not asking you to build  this end to end, but just a few topics
Sample Submission Guidelines - We are sharing with you our secret sauce, on techniques we have used to make engaging content

2. Project - These are Kaggle style problem statements and datasets and we take learners through a guided appproach to solve these by dividing a large problem statement into smaller tasks with instructions
